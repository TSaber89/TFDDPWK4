## Earthquakes in Fiji


   The Quakes dataset was used to complete the requirements for the final project 
   of the Developing Data Products class.

   The Quakes dataset consisted of a dataframe of 1000 observation over 5 
   variables.  

   Only the magnitude and the number of observations were used for the application

Project Description

- First, a Shiny application was created and deployed on R Studio servers.  
        The code for the server.R and UI.R was added to Github. 

- Second, a presentation was created to pitch the product.  

The next two slides demonstrate the use of a 

- widget
- operations on the UI in server.R
- reactive output will be displayed as a result of the server calculations
